## Introduction

This is a simulation of a basic blackjack strategy. 8 decks are used, though this can be changed upon deck initialization.

## Strategy

Simply setting a threshold for which the player will not hit above. The player does not consider the dealer's hand. Whether that threshold is 8 or 17, results are fairly consistent with a ~3.3% house edge. While not as performant as mainstream blackjack strategies, it is certainly better than hitting erratically.
